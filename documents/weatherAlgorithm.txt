Inputs-
    Start.lat
    Start.long
    End.lat
    End.long
    duration

Variables uses:
    numberPoints = duration/7200;  //7200 is number of seconds in 2 hours
    latDist = End.lat - Start.lat;
    longDist = End.long - End.long;

point(x)
    lat  = x * (latDist/numberPoints) +  Start.lat
    long = x * (longDist/numberPoints) + Start.long
